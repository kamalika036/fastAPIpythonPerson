DEVELOP A REST Person API ENDPOINT TO PERFORM BASIC CRUD OPERATION FOR 
FINDING CREATING UPDATING AND DELETEING A GROUP OF PERSONS.

THIS IS BACKEND PART OF THE FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT WHERE FRONT END WILL BE CREATED
USING ANGULAR FRAMEWORK.

THIS REST API IS CREATED BY PYTHON FASTAPI FRAMEWORK.

THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES MAY BE SPRING BOOT / PYTHON FLASK FRAMEWORK.

I HAVE CHOSEN FASTAPI AS IT IS ASYNCHRONUS IN OPERATION RESULTING MORE THROUGHPUT.

THE BACKEND DB IS SQLITE AS SQLITE IS INTEGRATED WITH PYTHON BUT IT CAN BE DONE
USING ORACLE ETC.

TO SAVE A NEW Person WE HAVE USED ORM IN PYTHON---> OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING

TO IMPLEMENT ORM WE HAVE USED SQLALCHEMY IN PYTHON
